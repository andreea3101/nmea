- Memory usage scales linearly with vessel count


## Identified Issues and Potential Bugs

### 1. 6-bit ASCII Encoding Issue

**Location**: `nmea_lib/ais/encoder.py`  
**Severity**: Minor  
**Description**: During AIS validation testing, the 6-bit ASCII encoding shows incorrect expected values in test output.

```
Binary: 111111 -> Encoded: 'o' (Expected: '?')
‚ùå Incorrect
```

**Analysis**: The binary value `111111` (decimal 63) should encode to character `?` (ASCII 63+48=111), but the test expects `?` while getting `o`. This suggests either:
- Test expectation is wrong, or
- Encoding table has incorrect mapping

**Impact**: Low - Round-trip encoding/decoding works correctly, suggesting the core functionality is sound.

**Recommended Fix**: Review the 6-bit ASCII character mapping table against ITU-R M.1371 specification.

### 2. Module Import Path Issues

**Location**: `tests/test_nmea_lib.py`  
**Severity**: Minor  
**Description**: Unit tests fail to import `nmea_lib` module when run directly.

```python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nmea_lib'
```

**Analysis**: The test file uses absolute imports but doesn't account for Python path when run directly.

**Impact**: Low - Tests work when run from proper context, but developer experience is affected.

**Recommended Fix**: Add proper path handling or use relative imports in test files.

### 3. Potential Thread Safety Issues

**Location**: `simulator/core/enhanced_engine.py`  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Shared state access between threads may not be fully protected.

**Analysis**: 
- Vessel generators dictionary is accessed from multiple threads
- Statistics counters are updated without locks
- Output handler list modifications during runtime

**Impact**: Medium - Could cause race conditions under high load or rapid configuration changes.

**Recommended Fix**: Add proper locking mechanisms for shared state access.

### 4. Error Handling Gaps

**Location**: Various network output handlers  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Description**: Network errors may not be handled gracefully in all scenarios.

**Analysis**:
- TCP client disconnections may not clean up properly
- UDP broadcast failures could cause thread termination
- File output errors might not trigger fallback mechanisms

**Impact**: Medium - Could cause simulation interruption or resource leaks.

**Recommended Fix**: Implement comprehensive error handling with retry mechanisms and graceful degradation.

### 5. Configuration Validation

**Location**: `simulator/config/parser.py`  
**Severity**: Low  
**Description**: Configuration validation may not catch all invalid parameter combinations.

**Analysis**:
- Speed/course variation ranges not validated
- MMSI uniqueness not enforced
- Output port conflicts not detected

**Impact**: Low - Invalid configurations may cause runtime errors rather than startup failures.

**Recommended Fix**: Add comprehensive configuration validation with clear error messages.
